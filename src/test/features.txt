Error handling:

    for arff files : 
        If any discrepancy in file format or missing data, it is caught in a error message with detailed info on how to fix the error.
        Missing attributes are handled  -> For train files the row containing missing attributes is ignored
                                        -> For test files, missing attributes are given a mean or median value.
        During test phase or during class inferencing the header of test and train files are matched and error messages are displyed with suggestions to correct the mismatch.                                        
                                        
    for csv files :
        The structure of the data is automatically inferred after reading the file and a pseudo header equivalent to that in an arff file is   created.
        The structure of the file is verified. The no of rows on each row should be equal
